====== Optimize URL Generator ======

It is important to note that each time you put a link in your view, the Router::url() method is called and the URL string is computed.

Now think about a page full of links, and also you'll see that this URLs have common parts. For example, the typical index actions shows a list rows, and in each row there is a link to edit and delete. The fact is that this links have the pattern /:controller/:action/:id. 

The idea here is that is not necessary to calculate the part /:controler/:action in each time a URL is generated.

To do that put this code snippet on your app/AppHelper.php.

<code>
	var $urls = array();
	/* increases url performance in 50%, by "caching" urls */
	function url($url = null, $full = false){
		//return $this->url($url);
		if ($full || !is_array($url) || array_diff(array_keys($url), array('controller', 'action', 0, 1, 2, 3, 4))){
			return parent::url($url, $full);
		}
		if (!isset($url['controller']))
			$url['controller'] = $this->params['controller'];
		if (!isset($url['action']))
			$url['action'] = $this->params['action'];
		$key = $url['controller'].'#'.$url['action'];
		if (!isset($this->urls[$key])){
			$pre = $this->urls[$key] = parent::url(array('controller' => $url['controller'], 'action' => $url['action']));
		}else 
			$pre = $this->urls[$key];
		for ($i=0; $i<4; $i++)
			if (isset($url[$i]))
				$pre.=DS.$url[$i];
		return $pre; 
	}
