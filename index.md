I am a computer scientist. I have graduate from [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://ufrgs.br/) in 2012. My technical interests include programming contents and challenges, software engineering techniques, Software as a Service (SaaS), Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Information Retrieval.

I have created this blog as a replacement of my old wiki website [http://inf.ufrgrs.br/~labianchin](http://inf.ufrgrs.br/~labianchin). I intent to use this space to share some knowledge.
